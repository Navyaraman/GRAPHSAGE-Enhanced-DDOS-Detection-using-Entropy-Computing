# GRAPHSAGE-ENHANCED-DDOS-DETECTION-WITH-ENTROPY-COMPUTING
A machine learning project focused on detecting Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks using an enhanced GraphSAGE model combined with Graph Attention Networks (GAT). This approach leverages entropy computing for improved feature selection and anomaly detection in network traffic data.
